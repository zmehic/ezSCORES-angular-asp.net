# ezSCORES
My colleague [Ensar Čevra](https://github.com/EnsarCevra) and I have spent the last semester working together on our seminar paper for a subject called "Software development 1" at the Faculty of Information Technologies here in Mostar. Seminar paper included a web application built with Angular(Frontend) and ASP.NET Core(Backend) with an MS SQL Database and docomentation for everything mentioned. With the help from our prof. Denis Music and TA Adil Joldic, we've managed to showcase some of the basic and advanced concepts that we had learned throughout the semester.

As of today, our tournament management system was used in the following tournaments (Updated 8th of June, 2024):
- [FIT Coding Challenge's Sport Challenge 2024](https://cc.fit.ba/)
- [University league for students 2024 at the University "Džemal Bijedić"](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/YoX388kuSbpAsWSS/)
